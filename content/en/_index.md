## Our Strategy

---

### In September 2025, Huntington’s Disease hit international headlines. A “cure” had been discovered – or at least, the most exciting scientific breakthrough we had ever seen. For the first time, millions of people were talking about Huntington’s Disease. 

### For the first time, people outside of the HD community are paying attention. 

### We want to hold this attention. <b>Ride this wave</b> and <b>build an HD Movement, together.</b>

## Our Aims
---
<b>Building a Fund</b> that is accessible to families when a cure becomes available. For families already burdened with the financial strain of care, loss, and medical costs, the price of a lifesaving treatment could be out of reach. We are here to change this. We believe that everyone should have access to treatment, no matter their income. Whether in 5, 10, or 15 years, we want to alleviate the financial burden.

<b>Raising Awareness and Advocacy</b> is an essential part of medical research. The more people that care about Huntington’s Disease, the better chance we have of approving medication that can help save lives. By supporting our work, you are joining the HD movement–showing solidarity to thousands of families that have been fighting this fight alone for generations.
