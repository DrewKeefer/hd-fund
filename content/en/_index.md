## Our Mission

---

### We are closer than ever to slowing, stopping, or even preventing the devastating impact of HD.

### However, a cure on the shelf is not the same as a cure in the hands of affected families.

### Our goal is to make sure that treatment is accessible by need, rather than by wealth.
