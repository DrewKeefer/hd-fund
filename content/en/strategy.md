#### This fund will be managed and governed by experts with experience -- people who have been directly impacted by Huntington's Disease.

## Your donation will be channelled into two vital areas:

---
#### 1
### Financial Access

When, not if, a cure becomes publicly available, it won't come cheap. For families already burdened with the financial strain of care, loss, and medical costs, the price of a lifesaving treament could be out of reach. We will make sure they are not priced out of hope.

#### 2
### Supporting Research

A cure may be on the horizon, but the journey from discover to delivery is long and expensive. We will invest in continued research to speed up access to safe, effective treatments, and ultimately, a cure that reaches the people who needs it most.
